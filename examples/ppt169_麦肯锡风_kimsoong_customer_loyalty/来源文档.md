# Kimsoong Customer Loyalty Programme - Source Document

## CASE STUDY 3: Getting to know you

### Background

Kimsoong, a Korean car manufacturer, has its European headquarters near Paris. It has retail sales franchises in most European countries, which not only sell cars and motor accessories but also have servicing facilities. The larger outlets also offer fast-fitting of tyres and exhausts, and deal in used cars.

Over the last ten years Kimsoong, with its reputation for reliability at low prices, have built up market share at the lower end of the market. Their basic models include many 'extras' which other manufacturers charge for. Kimsoong also makes large donations to environmental groups and is seen as an organisation with a social conscience. Furthermore, its R&D Department is developing an 'eco-car' which uses an alternative power source.

### Problems

Intense competition is forcing Kimsoong to consider new ways of generating business. Management believe that if the company looks after existing customers well, they may buy three or four Kimsoong vehicles over a ten-year timespan. Therefore, Kimsoong's new strategy is to hold on to existing customers and increase customer loyalty. They also hope to develop a more accurate buyer profile. (At present, data is from questionnaires sent to customers following sales but only 40% are returned). However, because of pressure on profits, they need to achieve these objectives at a low cost.

### Solutions

A customer loyalty programme will be developed by the Customer Services Department at head office. It will be available to all European franchises and its costs will be shared 50/50 with head office.

**Programme Aims:**

- To build up long-term customer relationships, thereby increasing profits
