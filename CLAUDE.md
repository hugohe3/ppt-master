# CLAUDE.md

This file is the project entry point for Claude Code.

Before any PPT generation task, **you MUST first read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md)** — the authoritative workflow for project creation, role switching, serial execution, quality gates, post-processing, and export.

## Project Overview

PPT Master is an AI-driven presentation generation system. Multi-role collaboration (Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor) converts source documents (PDF/DOCX/URL/Markdown) into natively editable PPTX with real PowerPoint shapes (DrawingML).

**Core Pipeline**: `Source Document → Create Project → Template Option → Strategist Eight Confirmations → [Image_Generator] → Executor → Quality Check → Post-processing → Export PPTX`

> Decks containing data charts: run the standalone [`verify-charts`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/verify-charts.md) workflow between the executor and post-processing steps to calibrate chart coordinates.
>
> Recorded narration / video export: run the standalone [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/generate-audio.md) workflow after post-processing.

## Execution Requirements

- Read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before starting a PPT task.
- For standalone template creation, read [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md).
- Role-specific rules live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/).
- Technical SVG/PPT constraints live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards.md).
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) and this file inside this repository.

## Command Quick Reference

## Architecture

- `skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md` — main workflow authority.
- `skills/ppt-master/references/` — role definitions and technical specifications.
- `skills/ppt-master/scripts/` — runnable tool scripts.
- `skills/ppt-master/scripts/docs/` — topic-focused script docs.
- `skills/ppt-master/templates/` — layout templates, chart templates, icon library.
- `examples/` — example projects.
- `projects/` — user project workspace.
