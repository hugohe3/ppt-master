# Visual Styles — Index

A **visual style** is how the deck **looks** — shape language, decoration density, whitespace rhythm, typographic character, texture / elevation. Lock **one per deck**; it anchors the aesthetic of the SVG layout itself (cards, dividers, spacing, corner radius, shadow use).

> **Styles carry NO HEX and lock no palette.** Color truth lives in `design_spec.colors` / `spec_lock.colors` (confirmation `e`); color *behavior* lives in [`image-palettes/`](../image-palettes/). A visual style only describes how the deck's existing colors are *used* — never which colors. (Same discipline as [`image-renderings/`](../image-renderings/) for AI images.)
>
> A visual style is *not* a mode. **Visual style = how it looks; mode = how you argue** (see [`modes/_index.md`](../modes/_index.md)). Locked independently — any style pairs with any mode.

## 1. Catalog

Each style has its own file with: shape & decoration, typography character, color-usage discipline (no HEX), texture / elevation, and the paired image-rendering. **Read only the file for the style you lock** — never glob the directory. The catalog mirrors [`image-renderings`](../image-renderings/_index.md): each style's "Paired rendering" names the illustration family that shares its aesthetic.

> The **`visual_style` value is only ever a first-column `id`** (`swiss-minimal`, `editorial`, …). The "Paired rendering" column lists **§h image-rendering** names (`flat`, `minimalist-swiss`, `digital-dashboard`, …) — never lock one of those as the `visual_style`; they belong to confirmation h.

> When the deck has AI images, align style with rendering: a `swiss-minimal` layout reads best with a `minimalist-swiss` rendering, so page and illustrations share one aesthetic. The "Paired rendering" column is the default pairing; override when content demands.
>
> Not every image-rendering becomes its own visual style. A rendering earns a layout twin only when it defines a whole-page layout language (shape, whitespace, composition, texture) — not merely how an inserted image looks. Purely atmospheric renderings (`nature`, `warm-scene`, `fantasy-animation`) stay imagery-only: they pair with whichever layout style fits rather than being one. (Note the distinction `photo-editorial` draws: photography as a *rendering* is image-look, but photo-*led composition* is a real layout language — so the style exists, paired with `corporate-photo`.)

## 3. Escape hatch — `custom`

When no preset captures the intended aesthetic, set `- visual_style: custom` in `spec_lock.md` and add a `- visual_style_behavior:` line: one paragraph naming shape language, decoration density, whitespace, typographic character, and texture — **no HEX, no color names as values**. `custom` is a tail-case, not a default; reach for a preset first.

## 4. How to use

1. Strategist reads this index at confirmation `d. Layer 2`.
2. Pick one style from the auto-selection table + the deck's vibe.
3. Lock it: write `- visual_style: <name>` into `spec_lock.md`, record rationale in `design_spec.md`.
4. Executor reads **only** `visual-styles/<locked-style>.md` at generation entry — never globs this directory.

**Lock scope**: deck-wide (one style per deck). It anchors taste as a **reference**, not a whitelist — pages may deviate with reason.
