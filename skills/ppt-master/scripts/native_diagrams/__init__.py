"""Native-diagram library: lift editable DrawingML diagrams between decks.

Unlike the SVG pipeline (``pptx_to_svg`` -> ``svg_to_pptx``), this package never
re-renders. It lifts a slide's ``<p:sp>`` / ``<p:grpSp>`` XML verbatim and only
flattens theme dependencies (``schemeClr`` -> ``srgbClr``, theme fonts ->
typefaces) so the diagram is pixel-identical AND natively editable in any deck.

- ``extract_diagram`` — source ``.pptx`` slide -> self-contained component dir
- ``inject_diagram``  — component dir -> shapes appended into a target deck
- ``compose``         — combine several components into one new component

See ``references/native-diagrams.md`` for the placeholder contract consumed by the
SVG→PPTX converter.
